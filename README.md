# Number-Stuff-with-Java

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
     This program takes a string input of a 2-digit
     number and converts it into 2 single digit ints by
     subtracting with zero.
     Then the first and second digits are printed to the screen in order
     The sum of the two numbers is printed along with their
     product.
     Finally, the program takes the first digit, adds one to it
     then multiples by 10 and adds on the second digit to make
     a number 10 more than the original.
